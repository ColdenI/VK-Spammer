Instruction manual
The program interface is divided into tabs. The first tab is a spammer - a program for sending messages using VK access tokens. The second area is the console window. You can add and remove items from the lists (VK access tokens, VK user IDs to whom messages will be sent, message texts) You can send a single message by selecting the desired token, user ID and the desired text. In automatic mode, messages are sent randomly at a random interval, which is configured at the bottom of the first tab. The second tab is the profile settings via token tab. The third tab - in it you can save VK user IDs and VK tokens (with commemorations (name)). The fourth tab is about the project. The token can be obtained on the website (https://vkhost.github.io). The VK account ID can be found on the website (https://regvk.com/id). All program messages and execution/parameter errors.
